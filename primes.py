"""Primes
In this module we have a function, eratosthenes(n), that uses the Eratosthenes Sieve to produce a list of prime numbers.
The Eratosthenes Sieve removes multiples of primes, leaving behind all the prime numbers.  In our program we have the full
list of numbers up to n generate, then remove non primes from the list.  For example, if the user entered the number 10, 
the sieve would start with 2, then remove the numbers {4, 6, 8, 10}.  It would then move to the number 3, and proceed to 
remove {9}, since 6 had previously been removed.  Now our list contains {2, 3, 5, 7}. 

Additionally, this module contains the function gen_eratosthenes() that generates the next prime number each time it is 
implemented.
